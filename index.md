I'm a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona. This is my personal website, which I'll be using to keep track of my research & community activity (among other miscellaneous things). 

<!-- ## About me -->

### My research interests

* Contextualized representations.
* Linguistic abilities of Language Models.
* Syntax and dependency parsing.
* Natural language processing for social good.


### Python!

I am the president of [the `Barcelona Python Association`](http://pybcn.org/), PyBCN, and the cofounder and coordinator of [PyladiesBCN](http://pybcn.org/pyladies-bcn/), a group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.


### Photography

Proud owner of a borrowed Nikon D70. Have a look at what I do in <a href="https://acontrallum.github.io" target="_blank">`acontrallum`</a>]!
