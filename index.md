I'm a PhD student in Natural Language Processing at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona. This is my personal website, which I'll be using to keep track of my research & community activity (among other miscellaneous things). 

<!-- ## About me -->

### My research interests

* Deep Learning for natural language processing.
* Natural language processing for social good.
* Dependency parsing and its application to downstream applications.


### Python!

I am the president of [PyBCN](http://pybcn.org/), the `Barcelona Python Association`. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance the local Python community through monthly meetups, practice sessions and specific events like PyDay and PyData.

Also, I'm cofounder and coordinator of [PyladiesBCN](http://pybcn.org/pyladies-bcn/), a group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences and events.
